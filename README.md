# Community Languages App

As part of Manchester Codes final project we created a community language app called Conversa (meaning 'talk' in Portuguese). The purpose of the app is to connect users within a local community who want to practise a second language or want to maintain a native language (i.e. refugee living in UK)

The Test-Driven Development (TDD) method was used to test the basic functionality of the app
